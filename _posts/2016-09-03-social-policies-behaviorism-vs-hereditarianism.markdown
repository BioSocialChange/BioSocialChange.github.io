##Some large-scale social goals:

1. An informed public. This requires multiple components: schooling, adequate nutrition, adequate sleep, innate curiosity, and innate cognitive horsepower.
2. Trust. The opposite of trust is fear, and fear is caused by things like crime and disease.
3. Long time horizons. Short-term thinking has many causes, such as short lifespans, impatience, and poor incentives.

If you don’t share these goals, then naturally you’ll disagree with much of the rest of this piece, although they seem to be goals which are widely shared.

Another possible critique could come from thinkers like Foucault and Habermas, who claim that there’s inherent danger in thinking about human populations from a scientific perspective, which tends to ignore the individual human spirit and strip life of dignity.

Whether science strips life of dignity is outside the scope of this paper, which is only focusing on plausible avenues for progress backed by evidence. Likewise, I’ll also be setting aside some of the more hypothetical ideas, such as whole brain emulation.

##Behaviorist Reforms	

It cannot be denied that environmental factors, particularly involving civilization, have deeply changed the human animal in ways that can scarcely be understated.

We have established systems of law, to provide order, and property, to encourage production. These make the assumption of some level of rationality on the part of the public, and as such, lay down incentives for following these rules.

In developed nations, we have achieved near-universal literacy and basic numeracy by free, but compulsory, public elementary schooling. This fact places our contemporary populace in stark contrast with the vast majority of generations of our species, and indeed even when compared to merely the past few thousand years.

Simple things like being able to track time immeasurably impact the agency of humans. Computer literacy has quickly become as crucial of a skill as reading, and needs to be treated with the same level of seriousness.

* Promote early education in practical computer usage, and make more advanced computer courses mandatory.
* Nurturing parents are irreplaceable, and all orphans need to find loving homes.
* Develop sophisticated AI caretakers to supplement human caretakers
* Early childhood exposure to friendly animals
* Sousveillance to create a panopticon effect, encouraging good behavior
* Sex robots and virtual reality to be an outlet for those who are sexually frustrated
* Encourage non-smoke-based nicotine use to augment operant conditioning (for studying, exercise, etc)  (cite gwern)
* Under universal healthcare systems, maintain something like deductibles and HSA accounts to create incentives to care for health.
* Automatic drug delivery systems to eliminate non-compliance with pharmaceutical regimens, and particularly among participants in clinical trials.
* Fitness trackers and “Quantified Self” data to discover strange correlations in one’s habits.
* Biofeedback
* Meditation and vagus nerve stimulation
* Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
* Binaural Beats

##Hereditarian Reforms

Despite the demonstrable usefulness of behaviorist approaches, they are by no means free of the potential for tyrannical uses. But the same is true of the opposite approach, hereditarianism. The dangers of eugenics in the context of state power are now well-known.

Yet, for the same reason that not all behaviorist approaches are equivalent to Clockwork Orange, not all hereditarian approaches have the danger of state-directed eugenics. However, the main characteristic that they all share is their effect upon the genetic traits of future generations.

Various traits might be sought, such as empathy, the ability to delay gratification, longevity, curiosity, and intelligence.

###Consider some examples:

* Promotion of birth control, contraceptives, plan B, first trimester abortion, etc.
* Student loan forgiveness for all college graduates on a per-child basis
* Federally mandated paid maternal and paternal leave
* Encourage high-skilled immigration such as via H1-B
* Eliminate conjugal visits for violent criminals
* Optional castration for sex offenders in exchange for reduced prison sentences.
* Encourage use of donor gametes: protect donor rights, allow compensation to donors, mandate health insurance coverage for recipients.
* Legalize and subsidize embryo selection
* Compile a modal human genome
* Use CRISPR to modify human embryos closer to modal, except on genes with known benefits

##Compatibilist Reforms

Certain reforms operate in the grey area between genes and environment, and can be acceptable or even attractive to both camps.

Pollution can cause mutation, even heritable mutations. And high disease rates tend to select for those with hyperactive immune systems, which create systemic inflammation that harms people in countless ways.

Even certain epigenetic changes have some preliminary evidence for heritability of a kind.

* Federal mandate to eliminate all lead pipes
* Federal mandate to require hands-free doorways, elevators, and bathrooms in all buildings open to the public.
* Tax shifts to encourage new construction free of lead paint, asbestos, etc.
* Fund a war on toxoplasmosis
* Treat sleep deprivation as an epidemic. Reduce work hours?
* More research on epigenetic triggers and heritability
* Prizes for cheap bluetooth spectrometers and other testing equipment
* Establish decentralized food safety websites (“continuous integration” for food safety)
* Increase fortifications of Vitamin D, Iodine, and Magnesium in food
* Increase silica levels in the water supply
* Discuss Julian Savulescu’s proposal of fortifying the water supply with nootropics.
* Put bold warning labels on products with significant licorice (it damages developing brains)
* Fortify vegan foods with Taurine
* Optimized baby formulas with EPA/DHA, uridine, etc
* Use Soylent as a control group for nutritional studies
* Mandatory f.lux dimming in all electronic devices, turned on by default.
* Nootropics
** Cacao
** Magnesium L-threonate
** Piracetam
** Theanine
